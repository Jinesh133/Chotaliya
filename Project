Question 1:
1.1. In inventory management, the economic order quantity (EOQ) is calculated using the 
following formula:
𝐸𝑂𝑄 = √
2𝐾𝐷
𝐻
Where:
 𝐷: Annual demand
 𝐾: Order cost
 𝐻: Unit holding cost
Code a program in Python to get the input data (D, K, H) from the user and then, calculate the 
economic order quantity.
1.2. Test your code to calculate the economic order quantity using the following data:
 𝐷 = 100000 units
 𝐾 = $2000
 𝐻 = $100
